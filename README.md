# English to Cantonese Jyutping Translator Hack

Translate from English to Cantonese Jyutping (Romanization) without the use of any training data or machine learning. This is very quick.

Google Translate does do a great job of differentiating between traditional and simplified Chinese characters. Type “horse” in English, and you’ll be given “馬” if you choose traditional characters, and “马” if you choose simplified. However, for both traditional and simplified characters, the romanization given with the character is “Mǎ”, and this is Pinyin. What we really should have is “馬, maa5” for Cantonese, and “马, mǎ” for Mandarin. Google translate incorrectly uses Pinyin for Cantonese. What we really want here is Jyutping. 

The use of Pinyin for both the traditional and simplified characters simply shows that by “Chinese,” Google means “Mandarin Chinese.” So actually, Cantonese isn’t supported at all. We don’t only want to add Jyutping, but we want to add Cantonese as a supported language. Sadly, I don’t have a direct phone line to anyone at Google who could help me with this, so I came up with a work around.
